Additional Info

Occasionally, no players will spawn when starting the game, I'm not sure why this is, the problem only exists when implemented 
in this website and never cropped up while it was seperate, but simply close the window and restart the server and it should 
function normally

Clicking at the game over screen will cause a repeating music track. Also the game can't be replayed unless its refreshed
