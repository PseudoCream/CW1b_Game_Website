    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Champions of Ivredia is a fast-paced 2D party fighting game with a medieval gothic setting. The game pits 2-4 players against each other in a last player standing scenario.
        The game is not deep or difficult enough for it to adhere with hardcore fans but there is a slight competitive feel to the game. The game is suited as a small party game as
        it is quick and can have multiple people playing simultaneously. The game is exclusive to PC as it requires a browser that supports HTML 5 to be played. It will be developed
        in JavaScript using Phaser 3.55.2 "Ichika" which is the most recent stable version of the Phaser framework.
    </p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p><br>For the player(s) to win the game they must be the last surviving player, they will have to avoid or attack other players while avoiding obstacles on the map such
        as spikes or falling into the abyss which will both kill the players instantly. The player can choose to focus on surviving by evading oncoming attacks or risk failing
        to take out other players through combat. Each round an assortment of weapons and powerup items will fall from the top of the map at randomised times to aid players
        but they will have to be quick to ensure another player doesnâ€™t snatch the items first.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Art and Visual Design</h2>
    <p> <br>The games environment will be created using a number of asset packs in the GothicVania series by Ansimuz that can be found on itch.io. We decided using assets from these
        packs would allow us to create unique levels but keep the design cohesive. Each asset pack will represent a different kingdoms environment.<br>
        <center> <img src="../Assets/Sprites.png" id="sprite"></center>
    </p>
    <p> <br>Each player will play as a different character sprite to represent the difference in kingdoms the champions fight for.<br></p>

    <h2>Levels</h2>
    <p><br>The games environment will be created using a number of asset packs in the GothicVania series by Ansimuz that can be found on itch.io.
        We decided using assets from these packs would allow us to create unique levels but keep the design cohesive. Each asset pack will represent
        a different kingdoms environment.<br>
        <br>While creating the concepts for the design of levels we looked at the levels within the game Stick Fight, as well as looking into common design typologies for 2D platformers.
        The structure of the levels with start off fairly simple, as levels progress more obstacles will be added, such as more edges to fall down, the introduction of moving platforms
        and spikes. And overall, more challenging layouts which will make it easier for players to coroner each other.<br>
        Levels are designed to make it easy to fall off platforms, so it adds an element of having to be careful of your movements. So, when people start panicking and jumping,
        they are more likely to fall and die, to ensure the rounds go quicker and keep the fast past nature of the game.
